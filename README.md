## Alexa Skill Laravel Demo 

This is a demo implementing a basic, but still full functional Alexa Skill.

It is basically the "guess the number demo", where the user chooses a maximum number, 
Alexa extracts a random number in the range [0, max], and then the user has to guess the number.
After each guess, Alexa tells if the number is greater or smaller than the guess.
When the user makes the correct guess, Alexa says how many attempts were required.
